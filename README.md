# Titanic Survival Prediction

The Titanic challenge on Kaggle is a competition in which the task is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing him such as his age, his sex, or his passenger class on the boat.

This is my first try on the challenge, even my first project on the field of Machine Learning. I have recently achieved an accuracy score of 0.72 on the public leaderboard, which is not so good. I am a new guy in the field. I make the prediction via the **Desicition Tree Classifier**. My work is stored in the file `titanic.ipynb` and `titanic.pdf`. My final result is stored in the file `submission.csv`. The decision tree I got is in `decision_tree_v1.pdf`. The tree is hard to read, actually. I use **k fold cross validation** with `cv = 10`.



## Overview (from Kaggle)

The data has been split into two groups:

- training set (`train.csv`)
- test set (`test.csv`)

**The training set** should be used to build your machine learning models. For the training set, we provide the outcome (also known as the "ground truth") for each passenger. Your model will be based on "features" like passengers' gender and class. You can also use [feature engineering ](https://triangleinequality.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/basic-feature-engineering-with-the-titanic-data/)to create new features.

**The test set** should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for each passenger. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each passenger in the test set, use the model you trained to predict whether or not they survived the sinking of the Titanic.

We also include **gender_submission.csv**, a set of predictions that assume all and only female passengers survive, as an example of what a submission file should look like.

| embarked     | Port of Embarkation                        | C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton |



### Variable Notes

**pclass**: A proxy for socio-economic status (SES)
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

**age**: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

**sibsp**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)

**parch**: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
Parent = mother, father
Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
